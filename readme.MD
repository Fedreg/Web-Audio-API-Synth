A Music Generator utilizing the Web Audio API

To create music enter text in either or both of the text entry fields.  

Enter digits from 1-25 to play notes.  leave a space after each entry

1 = c
2 = c# 
3 = d 
etc up until a high C at number 25

You can also enter chords directly.

Enter "A" for A Major.
"a" for a minor.
"a#" for Bb minor (no flats supported at this time; use enharmonic spelling).

The text entry is a grid of 16th notes (or 8ths if you prefer to think of it that way).

So if I want to leave a half note space in between notes I need to tap the space bar 8 times.

Paste this in for a quick example: e 5 7 5 7 5 4 5 a 5 7 5 8 5 4 5 e 5 7 5 7 5 4 5 B 7 8 7 10 7 8 7 e 5 7 5 7 5 4 5 a 5 7 5 10 5 9 5 e 5 17 16 15 14 13 12 B 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 e e   e

COMING SOON:
Wave type, note duration, filters, all customizable per synth.  DONE
Repeats will also be introduced shortly
