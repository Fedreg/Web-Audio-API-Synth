A Music Generator utilizing the Web Audio API

To create music enter text in either or both of the text entry fields.  

Enter digits from 1-25 to play notes.

1 = c
2 = c# 
3 = d 
etc up until a high C at number 25

You can also enter chords directly.

Enter "A" for A Major.
"a" for a minor.
"a#" for Bb minor (no flats supported at this time; use enharmonic spelling).

The text entry is a grid of 16th notes (or 8ths if you prefer to think of it that way).

So if I want to leave a half note space in between notes I need to tap the space bar 8 times.

COMING SOON:
Wave type, note duration, filters, all customizable per synth.
Repeats will also be introduced shortly
